# Movie-Recommendations

To find some movie recommendations, simply compile gui.py after installing the necessary libraries as seen in the file. The GUI should be displayed and have thorough instructions on how to find recommended movies given a movie that the user inputs. Pictured below is an example of the GUI in full capacity:

To use this movie recommendation system with the most up-to-date movies, one should download the up-to-date movies dataset [directly through kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/akshaypawar7/millions-of-movies). If you wish to do this, you must name the CSV file "movies", place it in the "input" folder, and then run data_processing.py to create and save the processed_movies.csv file in the "input" folder. Now you're good to go. Just compile gui.py.
