# Movie-Recommendations

Create a folder labeled "input" in the same directory as the source files. The contents of the "input" folder can be accessed via [dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/m444bufmig1paz1/AAA9FAbi-5jcSMzaHNKUgnh8a?dl=0), or you can download the movie dataset [directly](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/akshaypawar7/millions-of-movies) and then run data_processing.py to create and save the processed_movies.csv file in the "input" folder.

Run gui.py after installing the necessary libraries to find some movie recommendations.
